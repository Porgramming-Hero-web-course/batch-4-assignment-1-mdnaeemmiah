Union Types:  

1.In programming, a union type is a type that can hold multiple different types of values. It is common in languages that support more advanced type systems, such as TypeScript.
2.In TypeScript, union types allow a variable to hold values of more than one type. You define a union type using the pipe (|) symbol.

Intersection Types:

1.Intersection types are the opposite of union types. They allow you to combine multiple types into a single one, meaning a value of that type must satisfy all of the combined types at once.

2.In TypeScript, intersection types are created using the & (ampersand) operator. A variable of an intersection type must conform to all the types involved in the intersection.
